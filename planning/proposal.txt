Project Idea:
'Travel-Tracker' is an app where users can document and relive their vacations, trips, and journeys. Users can view their user-specific database of travel entries, and log, edit, and delete their entries with information such as the destination, dates they traveled, images.

User stories:
-- MVP --
- As a traveler, I want to be able to log and create user-specific entries of my travels, complete with pictures and descriptions.
- As a traveler, I want to be able to view my past entries.
- As a user, I want to be able to login to a user-specific profile.
- As a user, I want to be able to edit and delete my entries.

-- Stretch goals --
- As a social-media user, I want to view other profiles.
- As a social-media user, I want to see other users' entries.
- As a traveler, I want to see on a map, the destinations I've traveled.
- As a user, I want to be able to use the app on my phone and internet browser.
